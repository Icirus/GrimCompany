Dear esteemed members of ___Grim Company___,

As the stalwart leader of our guild, it is my honor to rally the noble hearts and stout arms of our fellow adventurers for an urgent mission. Our eyes turn to Blackfathom Deeps, a formidable den of darkness and malevolence that threatens the peace of Azeroth.

In light of recent disturbances reported by our scouts and allies, it is imperative that we respond swiftly and decisively. The corrupted forces within Blackfathom Deeps have shown signs of resurgence, posing a growing threat to our lands and the innocent denizens nearby.

Therefore, I call upon the valorous members of ___Grim Company___ to assemble for a counter-attack against this impending darkness. Our expedition is scheduled to commence at 8:00 PM (Sunday/Thursday Server time), ensuring a coordinated assault when the veil of night embraces the land.

### _Our primary goal within Blackfathom Deeps is twofold:_ ###

- __Purge the Corruption:__ Engage and cleanse the corrupted denizens that dwell within the depths. Their malevolent influence must be expunged to restore harmony to these sacred grounds.

- __Recover Lost Artifacts:__ Seek out and recover any lost relics or artifacts that might aid us in understanding and combatting the growing threat. These treasures might hold crucial knowledge or power to aid our cause.


For this venture, we seek the participation of ten noble adventurers, valiant souls who are willing to face the darkness head-on and stand as beacons of hope in these trying times.

Remember, our success hinges not only upon our might but also on our unity, strategy, and unwavering determination. Let us stand together, ___Grim Company___, and face this challenge as one!

Those willing to answer this call to arms, please know we will be gathering in Astranaar to leave for the Deeps at 8:00pm(server time). Be prepared, for valor and honor shall guide our blades, shields, and spells in this righteous battle against the forces of darkness.

May the Light bless and protect us as we embark on this crucial mission!

For the glory of the Alliance and the honor of ___Grim Company___,

Icirus Stonebeard  
High Warden of ___Grim Company___
