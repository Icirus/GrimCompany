"Attention, stout-hearted kinfolk of Dun Morogh!

As I, Icirus Highbeard, stride through our beloved lands, a clarion call echoes across the snow-capped peaks! The time has come to assemble a fellowship of honorable souls under the banner of Grim Company. With shields raised high and hearts brimming with valor, we seek to unite in the name of camaraderie and purpose.

Gather 'round, ye stalwart dwarves and esteemed allies! Together, let us forge a guild that embodies resilience, camaraderie, and unyielding valor. To solidify this union, I am canvassing for signatures to inscribe our legacy into the annals of Dun Morogh.

If your heart beats for adventure, if your spirit yearns for camaraderie, and if your blade thirsts for righteous battles, then heed this call! Join me at the Thunderbrew Distillery in Kharanos to add your name to the sacred Grim Company charter. Let our valorous deeds resonate across these lands as a testament to our unity and strength.

May the Anvil's fire bless our endeavors as we embark on this noble journey together! For Khaz Modan, for the Alliance, for Grim Company!"

Icirus Highbeard, Paladin of Dun Morogh
