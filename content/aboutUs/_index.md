___Grim Company___ is a medium roleplaying Guild formed on the World of Warcraft Classic: Season of Discovery server Chaos Bolt. As such, things are very much in flux. Our primary goal of Grim Company is to provide a Role Playing environment where we can explore the "World" of Azeroth with a perspective of our character, and the wants and wishes of working within a faction with others that are seeking to explore the world with the same mindset. We are seeking to provide context for our characters actions, and ___Grim Company___ helps to provide that context. 

## FAQ
__What is the Mission of Grim Company within Azeroth?__  
Grim Company is still finding its place within the world of Azeroth. The guild charter was registered within Ironforge, so from a guild history standpoint we are closely affiliated with Ironforge politics and policies. This allegiance could shift overtime depending on the degrees of pressure the internal guild members provide and the roleplaying culture of the server. Ultimately, its all made up, but we do want to keep historical accuracy for the Guild's story and provide context for our actions. If we are running ganking squads in Stranglethorn Vale, we will have a backstory as to why we are performing these actions. 

__What is Medium Roleplay?__  
When we say medium Roleplay it means we have a few guidelines as we are getting started, and we will be developing more as required.

__What are the guidelines?__ 
___Chat Guildlines___
1. ___Guild Chat -- In character:___  Guild chat is in character always. In the off chance you need to communicate Out of Character(OOC) information to the whole guild, it should be in ((parenthesis)). This is something that will be enforced. We want to provide an environment for all Roleplayers. This includes people that want to play "High immersion" characters. We have an official OOC channel for anyone with the Grim Company tag and friends of the guild.  
_In order to be able to talk in Guild chat, all new recruits must meet with a member of Grim Company for an RP interaction. After completing the interaction, the recruit will be promoted to their appropriate rank and chat rights will be granted._

2. ___Say -- In character:___ This should largely be true for communication between guildies, but it can vary when discussing with members of the alliance outside of the guild. Even still, we want the perception of Grim Company to be that of an upstanding roleplaying guild, so interacting with the broader community in the character in /say is the goal. 

3. ___Party -- Out of Character:___ The reasons to communicate via party chat are so varying, it's hard to say one way or another. I would lean towards this being out of character, but it could clearly be used for in character communication if desired.

4. ___GrimCompanyOOC -- Out of Character:___ We have created a global channel for communicating out of character with each other. Not all members will join GrimCompanyOOC especially if they are playing high immersion characters. There are extensive chat options for customizing chat channels.

___Golden Rule___

___Be open to being helpful.___ Your character can 100% be a tool, but that doesn't mean your OOC actions can as well. We don't put up with using "Character motivations" dictate bad behavior. For example, saying "I'm Roleplaying a Rogue that ninja loots" isn't acceptable. We all know this is a ruse. Grow up. 


__What sort of activities does Grim Company like to do?__
* __Raiding__ -- You will see it mentioned as Joint Operations or RAIDing when discussed in character on the website. We are currently 7/7 in BFD. Read about the adventure [here]({{< ref "/content/jointOps/bfdefeated.md" >}} "Blackfathom Defeated"). 
* __PvP__ -- We love to pvp. This is why we rolled on an RP-PVP server.
    * _Small scale PVP / Ganking_ -- Think Patrols in STV or Southshore. 
    * _Premade Battle Grounds_ -- We dabble in Premades, but haven't officially ran any. It's something that has interesting appeal though.
* __Roleplay Events__ -- We are 100% down for role playing events, but I think this is a place that we struggle. Currently its more getting together for a pint in a pub vs zone spanning events. 

__Can my actions shape the guild?__
This is up to the player. Since we are a new guild, there isn't a lot of structure defined. We have a loose hierarchy, but beyond that we are figuring it out together. So if the right player wanted to participate in the shaping of the guild, they would absolutely have the space to do that. I think about Grim Company similar to a faction in a pen and paper campaign. You don't always get what you want from the faction, but the characters are always given the chance to make use the faction the way that they would want. 

__I've never Roleplayed, can I still join?__
Absolutely. You would just need to be willing to be a bit silly and play make believe with other people. It's can be amazing to see what happens if you put a few constraints and ambitions on a character and push for those goals. It can be fun to think about the motivations your character would have for wanting the shinny new weapon or mount.

__What timezone is the guild?__
We use the server time for all events. The server is currently Mountain Standard time. Raids have been scheduled for 8:00 Server time, but as with everything we are still figuring it out.

__Are their any mandatory addons?__
There are no mandatory addons, but two that I can highly recommend are:
* ___VoiceOver___ and the ___VoiceOver Vanilla___ pack -- This provides voice overs for most of the quests in game.
* ___Total RP 3___ -- This is a roleplaying addon that allows you to add extra details about your character. It also lets you see these details on others. It's not required to put much or any information on your profile. Having this installed helps provide a signal to those around you that you are open for roleplay. Just having that can help with the amount of walk up interactions you have in the game.
