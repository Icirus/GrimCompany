Grim Company thrives on a structured hierarchy that defines our roles and responsibilities. Starting from the eager newcomers to the esteemed leaders, each rank holds a purpose, ensuring order and efficiency within our community.

Our hierarchy begins with Initiates, those seeking to join our ranks. They strive to prove their dedication and fit within our guild's values. As they progress, they ascend through the ranks, each level bringing new responsibilities and opportunities for growth.

Champions, Sentinels, and Guardians form our backbone, leading groups, organizing events, and ensuring our daily operations run smoothly. Veteran Protectors and Defenders contribute their experience -- guiding the newer recruits.

At the helm stands the High Warden, our Guild Leader, and the Lord Justiciars. Their vision and decisions shape the course of Grim Company, representing our values and steering us toward success.
