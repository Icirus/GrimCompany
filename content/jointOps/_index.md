In order to safeguard the interests of __Grim Company__, and indeed the Alliance, the Reconnaissance And Ingression Directive(RAID) was created to address the most severe threats found within Azeroth. 

RAIDing parties and other coordinated efforts required communication and planning if there is any hope of a positive outcome. News of planned RAIDs on enemy strongholds will be announced here. 

_((Joint Operations are currently schedule for Sundays and Thursdays at 8:00pm server time(GMT-7), but these days are subject to change. As the Guild grows, we will continue to evaluate which days work best for the group. We will continue to base our scheduled times based on the Server's time zone.))_
