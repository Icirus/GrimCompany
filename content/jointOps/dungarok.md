*To Whom It May Concern,*

In recognition of the escalating threats to the safety and security of Dun Garok in the Hillsbrad Foothills, the Dwarven Senate of Ironforge hereby seeks the services of reputable companies of mercenaries and adventurers to reinforce the defenses of this strategic stronghold. It is imperative to fortify our positions and ensure the protection of our territories against potential hostile incursions.

The contract will enlist the support of up to 15 skilled adventurers, each to be compensated based on their rank within the Alliance forces. The payment structure is as follows:

- **Sergeant:** 45 silver per week (Minimum 3 weeks)

The terms of this contract encompass the provision of essential defensive services, including but not limited to:
  
- Patrol and perimeter defense duties resulting in at least 10 Horde honorable kills within the week.
- Assistance in fortification and maintenance of defensive structures.
- Readiness to engage in combat to repel any hostile threats to Dun Garok.

The primary executor of this contract shall be Icirus Stonebeard, appointed by the Dwarven Senate to oversee and manage the allocation of resources and tasks to the contracted mercenaries and adventurers.

All contracted parties are expected to uphold the highest standards of loyalty, bravery, and commitment to the Alliance's cause. Any breach of conduct or failure to fulfill contractual obligations will result in immediate termination of the agreement and forfeiture of payment.
