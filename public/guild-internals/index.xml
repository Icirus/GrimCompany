      <description>Grim Company thrives on a structured hierarchy that defines our roles and responsibilities. Starting from the eager newcomers to the esteemed leaders, each rank holds a purpose, ensuring order and efficiency within our community.&#xA;Our hierarchy begins with Initiates, those seeking to join our ranks. They strive to prove their dedication and fit within our guild&amp;rsquo;s values. As they progress, they ascend through the ranks, each level bringing new responsibilities and opportunities for growth.</description>
